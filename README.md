# Diabetes_pred
ML project made in R to predict if a person will have or not Diabetes.

In this project we focus on the pre-process and process of creating a ML model that predicts if a person will have or not Diabetes, a classification nproblem per-se.

The dataset is extracted from Kaggle.

The process: 
#
1.- We check the dataset.
#
2.- Check for outliers
3.- Removing outliers.
4.- Reviewing if there are any outliers left.
5.- Reviewing the data quality.
6.- by checking data quality, we realized that the DS presents a Class and Data Imbalance problem
7.- In the first try I solved the data imbalance problem by augmenting the data. Unfortunately it didn't improve much the final prediction.
8.- I tried with many PCA's, Naive BAyes and SVM to predict. But the results were similar in all cases.
